 -------------------------------------------
  >create user username identified by password;
   o/p: user created

  Note:username--related to ur projectname.(here refer username in System.properties file )

  goto-> Start--->run-->in  run type "imp", select ok.

  here data base import command prompt displayed;

  In that give ur username/password

  next  give the path of the dump file name.

  next press enter

  its asking (yes/no) for that select 'n'
  
  next 'y'
  next  'y'
